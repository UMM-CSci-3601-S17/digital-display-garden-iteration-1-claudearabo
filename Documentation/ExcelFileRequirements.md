#Excel File Requirements  
One of our priorities is to provide a modular future proof system for inputing an Excel file. We understand that the way you will want to use the Digital Dipslay Garden will evolve and that our code will have to be modular enough to keep pace. We have developed a parser capable of handeling formatting changes to the spreadsheets you will give to our system. With our code, you will be able to add, delete, and rearrange content with a large degree of freedom. This document walks through what our code needs from your Excel file.  

##File Type
Our code takes in a simple Excel file with a `.xlsx` file ending.
